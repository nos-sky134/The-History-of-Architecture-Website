            The Baroque style is a style that came from Italy around the 16th century, which is about 500 years ago. This style became popular for the next two centuries until about 1740 can also be seen around the world.
            <br></p>
        <h4>How did this style come to be?</h4><br>
        <p>
            There were lots of events happened at this time that made this style popular. One of the reasons was that at the time, the Catholic Church was treating it’s followers unequally. They only wrote the bible in latin so that only the priests and educated people could read it. They preached that Kings (and the Pope) were closer to God and superior than normal people. The Catholic Church was also doing terrible things to get more money, such as selling 'Indulgences' to grant sinners salvation from purgatory after they die. They also did not like the people who had different ideas about religion.

        <p>
            There was also a monk named Martin Luther who did not agree with this. He believed that the bible was the only authority of religion and that salvation is only achieved by good faith. He also thought that Pope Leo X was corrupt for selling indulgences to finance his plans to renovate the St Peter’s Basilica. In 1517 he wrote down these ideas and nailed them to the door of the University of Wittenberg. Then he started his own church called the Protestant church. His actions caused the Pope to exclude him from the Catholic Church in 1620 and he spent the next 10 years translating the New Testament to german. His movement was so powerful that the Catholic church lost followers. In order to gain back loyalty, the Catholic Church tried to make their churches as beautiful as possible to try to appeal to the public.

        <h4>What made this style unique?</h4><br>
        <p>
            The Church hired many artists, sculptors and architects together to make the building look dramatic and apealing. Architects during this period also like to use ovals and trapezoid shapes. The walls of these buildings are sometimes very curvy to make a small space seem like it was bigger and more impressive. These tactics were used to make the church more emotional, interesting and inviting.
        </p>


        <h4>Why was this style so popular?</h4><br>
        <p> This lavish style of building was very attractive to some and other buildings that were not religious began building in this style too, like palaces and government buildings. As religious leaders moved around the world to try to gain followers from colonies in the New World, they brought this style of building there as well. By the mid 17th century, baroque has spread to countries in South America like Mexico and Brazil.

        <h4 Class="Heading">Art Nouveau (1890-1910s)</h4>
        <h4 Class="Heading">Why lead to the development of this style?</h4>

        <p>
            &emsp; &emsp;This style of designing buildings is very strongly influenced by what was happening in the arts world at the time and is a direct response to the industrial style of architecture that had emerged.<br><br>
            &emsp; &emsp;At the time, European artists had very vigorous rules for what would be considered art and a strict hierarchy on the quality of art. Producing realistic art work was the goal of many professional painters at that time. However, the invention of the camera made some of this obsolete. In addition, many artists did not believe in the established view on the arts and wanted to create art that was completely different. They began to counter traditional art in movements that are later known as Impressionism and Art Nouveau. <br><br>
            After years of isolation, Japan opened up trading to Europe in 1853, for the first time, Japanese goods such as woodblock prints started being distributed into other parts of the world. This outside influence changed western ideas of art at the time. At the same time, some people began rejecting the inhuman look to buildings made in industrial style mentioned in the last lesson. Some people wanted to make buildings that had elements of craftsmanship to them. This movement is called the Arts and Crafts movement. <br><br></p>

                &emsp; &emsp; Art Nouveau movement has it's roots in England, where the idea of Arts and Crafts first began. This historic art movement moved beyond visual arts and became ingrained into the architecture of the time period. This movement also called for unity in design in houses and furniture so that things in the house matched one another. <br><br>

        <h4 Class="Heading">What is the Art Nouveau style?</h4>
        <p> &emsp; &emsp;The design of the art nouveau style included lots of whiplash lines; these were lines that curved back and forth. They used flat colors inspired from the Japanese prints that have become widespread rather than traditional methods. Botanists drawings of nature became much easier for the common artist to obstain and became a guide for artists. </p>

            <br>
            &emsp; &emsp;The first true art nouveau house is the Tassel house made in Belgium by architect Victor Huges, which had elements of the art nouveau mentioned above. The same architect also made 3 more townhouses in the same style. The style soon caught on and spread around Europe and America. You can see more about this and other notable art nouveau buildingsin the timeline. While art nouveau was short lived compared to other styles, it made a lasting impact on architectural history.

            &emsp; &emsp; In this time period, the trend of architectures developing their own style continues and this made this particular time-period a time where lots of ideas were being developed. We will learn more about different styles that emerged in the next chapter.
